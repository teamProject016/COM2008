# COM2008

## Software System
- Add the four departments 
  - Business School (BUS), Computer Science (COM), Psychology (PSY) and Modern Languages (LAN).
- Add the degrees 
  - MSc in Business Administration (lead BUS)
  - MEng Software Engineering with a Year in Industry (lead COM)
  - BSc Information Systems (lead COM, partners BUS, LAN)
  - MPsy Cognitive Science (lead PSY, partner COM).

1. Add realistic core and optional modules for each of the above degrees (take inspiration from the Sheffield University module-guide)
2. ensuring that modules are supplied by all relevant partner-departments
- the MSc degree will be all-core, but other degrees will have 20cr free choice at level 1, all-core at level 2, and 40cr free choice at levels 3 and 4.
- Register a student for each of the above degrees, and select both suitable and unsuitable options for their free-choice modules, showing how your system prevents administrators from picking the wrong modules and checks that a student’s credit-totals are correct.
- Progress these students through the levels, such that
  - the MSc student gets a conceded pass on taught modules, eventually passing MSc
with merit;
  - the MEng student passes through all levels, including the year in industry, getting a
1st class result;
  - the BSc student takes resits at level 1 and passes, but fails at level 2 resits, and also
after repeating level 2, so is prevented from progressing;
  - the MPsy student passes through three levels, but fails catastrophically at level 4, so
is graduated with a BSc class 2/i instead.


## Final Teamreport
The main purpose of the team report is to show your design process, leading to the implemented system, which will be handed in separately and tested. The data capture and data normalisation stage are especially important and should be done accurately, reflecting the background information exactly, and not contain extraneous material. The report should contain the following:
- a short introduction, clarifying any interpretations you made of the requirements;
- a UML class diagram of the initial information model, developed by analysing the given
background information, showing classes, attributes, associations and association classes.
All associations should have end roles and multiplicities;
- a UML class diagram of the normalised database model (using the UML database profile),
which should have normalised all the relationships in the initial information model and identified primary and foreign keys. All remaining associations should be directed, according to table-linkage;
- some screenshots (max 2 sides) showing off what you think are the best aspects of what your system can do (screenshots before/after critical events are best). Don’t cram in so much that it is unreadable;
- a short discussion of the security features your system implemented.
Your report must finish with two measures of the contribution and the effort put in by individuals in the team: the first is a factual account of what each person did; and the second is an agreed sharing out credit for effort invested, especially if this was disproportionate:
- a table describing what actual tasks were carried out by each individual;
- divide up 100 points among the team members, according to effort invested;
This last section must be signed off by all team-members to be valid, otherwise equal effort is assumed by default. Assessors reserve the right to alter effort scores if there is disagreement in the team.
The marking scheme will be as follows:
  - 30% for accurate UML Diagrams
  - 60% for correctly operating software
  - 10% for team working strategy
